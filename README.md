# MCP-Project
This project implements the Master Control Program (MCP) Ghost in the Shell. The primary job of the MCP is to run and schedule a workload of programs on a system. In order to schedule a workload of programs, the MCP reads a file which contains a list of programs and their arguments and run these programs. In order to run these programs, the MCP will start and run the programs as processes. Furthermore, the processes will be monitored by the MCP in order to ensure the processes are running concurrently in a time-slice manner as well as to track the processes utilization of system resources. This project holds four different sections which continue to build upon each other in order to gain experience in understanding processes, signals, signal handling, and scheduling through the implementation of the MCP.
